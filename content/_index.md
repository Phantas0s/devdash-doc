## Welcome to DevDash's Documentation

**DevDash is a highly configurable terminal dashboard for developers**.

It will allow you to choose and display the most up-to-date metrics you need, at one place.

The data will be automatically refreshed while you're doing other productive tasks.

What can you do with this documentation?

* To get started and creating your first dashboard, or see DevDash in action with many examples (including their configuration), [it's over there](/getting-started/).
* If you search the complete reference for DevDash dashboard's configuration, [you need to click on this link](/reference/).
* In order to change the display of your widgets (colors or size), [you can directly go here](/display/).
* Finally, to understand how to use time period for many widgets in DevDash, [you can go there](/time/).
