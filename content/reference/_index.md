You will find here a precise reference of every options you can use in DevDash's configurations, for every `project`, `service` and `widget`.

You can find here: 

* The highest configuration level, namely the [general options](/reference/general/) for your dashboard. 
* The second level is the `project` configuration: it's where you will give its title and declare its `services`.
* The third and fourth levels are the configuration of the `services` themselves and their `widgets`.

If you're unsure how should looks like a configuration file, you can go to the section [getting started](/getting-started/), and more particularly in its subsections [examples](/getting-started/examples) for simple configuration examples and [use-cases](/getting-started/uses-cases) to have real life use case of DevDash, with more complete configuration files.

Both of these subsections have some screenshot as well of the result, to give you an idea of the display of each configuration.
