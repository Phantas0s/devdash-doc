# Width

DevDash dashboards are based on a 12 columns grid.

You can indicate the width of a widget in number of column (1 to 12), or using the equivalent t-shirt size as described below:

| Name   | Number of columns   |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| xxs    | 1                   |
| xs     | 2                   |
| s      | 4                   |
| m      | 6                   |
| l      | 8                   |
| xl     | 10                  |
| xxl    | 12                  |

# Height

You can configure the height of each widget (the number of terminal's row the widget will take) with the `height` option.

Your terminal windows has a determined number of row. You can use the command `tput lines` in your shell to see the total number of row you can use.
