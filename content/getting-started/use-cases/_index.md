You will find use cases with screenshots and complete configuration in this section. It's basically how I use DevDash myself:

* If you have a blog, [you can use DevDash to display Google Analytics / Google Search Console data](/getting-started/use-cases/blog/).
* DevDash can be useful for side projects as well.
