You will find here real life use cases of DevDash, with screenshot and complete dashboard configurations. It shows how I use DevDash myself:

* If you have a blog, [you can use DevDash to display Google Analytics / Google Search Console data](/getting-started/use-cases/blog/).
* DevDash can be [useful for side projects as well](/getting-started/use-cases/devdash/).
